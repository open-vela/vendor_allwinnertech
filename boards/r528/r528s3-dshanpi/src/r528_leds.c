/* The dshanpi board has four green LEDs; three can be controlled from
 * software.
 * Two are tied to ground and, hence, illuminated by driving the output pins
 * to a high value:
 *
 *  1. LED1 SPI0_CLK  SPI0_CLK/UART5_RX/EINT23/PI11
 *  2. LED5 IPSOUT    From the PMU (not controllable by software)
 *
 * And two are pull high and, hence, illuminated by grounding the output:
 *
 *   3. LED3 RX_LED    LCD1_D16/ATAD12/KP_IN6/SMC_DET/EINT16/CSI1_D16/PH16
 *   4. LED4 TX_LED    LCD1_D15/ATAD11/KP_IN5/SMC_VPPPP/EINT15/CSI1_D15/PH15

 * These LEDs are not used by the board port unless CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS is
 * defined.  In that case, the usage by the board port is defined in
 * include/board.h and src/stm32_leds.c.
 * The LEDs are used to encode OS-related events as follows:
 *
 *   SYMBOL            Meaning                      LED state
 *                                              LED1 LED3 LED4
 *   ----------------- -----------------------  ---- ---- ---- ------------
 *   LED_STARTED       NuttX has been started   ON   OFF  OFF
 *   LED_HEAPALLOCATE  Heap has been allocated  OFF  ON   OFF
 *   LED_IRQSENABLED   Interrupts enabled       ON   ON   OFF
 *   LED_STACKCREATED  Idle stack created       ON   ON   OFF
 *   LED_INIRQ         In an interrupt          N/C  N/C  Soft glow
 *   LED_SIGNAL        In a signal handler      N/C  N/C  Soft glow
 *   LED_ASSERTION     An assertion failed      N/C  N/C  Soft glow
 *   LED_PANIC         The system has crashed   N/C  N/C  2Hz Flashing
 *   LED_IDLE          MCU is is sleep mode         Not used
 *
 * After booting, LED1 and 3 are not longer used by the system and can be used
 * for other purposes by the application (Of course, all LEDs are available to
 * the application if CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS is not defined.
